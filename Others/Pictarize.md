# Augmented Reality in Pictarize

**Augmented Reality (AR)** blends digital content with the physical world, allowing users to experience images, text, and sound layered over real-world environments through devices like smartphones or tablets.

**Pictarize** is a free, browser-based tool that lets users create simple AR experiences by linking virtual content (like images, videos, and sound) to physical images called targets. No app installation is requiredâ€”just open your camera and point to the target!
