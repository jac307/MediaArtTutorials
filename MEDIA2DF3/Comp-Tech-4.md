## Objective

Create **two typographic compositions** that visually express the meaning of selected words by manipulating letterforms. Inspired by **Bruno Munari’s** ideas in *The Shape of Words*, this activity explores how **typographic form, contrast, spacing, distortion, and composition** can be used to visually communicate ideas.

Each composition should:
- Clearly reflect the meaning of the word through visual treatment of type
- Demonstrate conceptual strength and creative experimentation
- Maintain consistency in **quality**, **craft**, and **style** across all three compositions

**Software**:  
- **Adobe Illustrator** (vector-based composition)  
- **Adobe Photoshop** (texture/image-based processing only)

## Activities  
**Complete the following activities in order. Ask your professor for help if needed.**

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[40–50 min] Tutorial – Recreation Exercise</h3>

### Task:
Follow the provided step-by-step tutorial on **expressive typography** to understand how to manipulate letterforms effectively.



- Complete the tutorial **exactly as instructed**
- Export and upload your final document as your **first submission**
- **Naming Protocol**: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech4-Tutorial.pdf`

> ⚠️ **Important**: Make sure you follow the document setup instructions to avoid losing points.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[15–20 min] Sketching – Concept Development</h3>

### Task:  
Choose **two words** that you will explore through typographic design.  
Create **two sketches**—one for each word—conceptualizing how you will convey its meaning visually.

### Use the following references and techniques:
- **Munari’s The Shape of Words** – Think about how letterforms can reflect meaning  
- **Visual Weight** – Bold vs. light, dense vs. open  
- **Visual Direction** – Flow, alignment, movement  
- **Design Principles** – Wong’s Principles (e.g., contrast, repetition, gradation) or Gestalt Principles (e.g., proximity, continuity, figure/ground)

> 💡 Tip: Consider how the **form of the word enhances the meaning**. For example, the word “fall” might descend diagonally, or “sharp” could use angular cuts.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[Rest of Class] Create Your Final Compositions</h3>

#### Document Setup (Required)  

> ⚠️ **You must follow the tutorial and file setup instructions exactly to avoid losing points.**  
> Skipping or incorrectly completing this step will affect your grade.

Before you begin, **watch the provided tutorial** on Illustrator document setup. Follow it step-by-step to create **one separate file per composition**.

  
**Your Illustrator document must include the following settings:**
- **Units:** Pixels  
- **Size:** 1000 × 1000 px (1:1 aspect ratio)  
- **Color Mode:** RGB  
- **Raster Effects:** High (300 PPI)  
- **Naming Protocol:** `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech4-#.ai`

### Design Requirements:
- Use **Adobe Illustrator** to build your final compositions
- Present **three variations** per word (as done in the tutorial)
- Letterforms must be **manually modified**
- If using images or textures, make sure they are **embedded** in the Illustrator file.

### Things to Consider:
- **Legibility vs. Expression** – Ensure the word is still readable while expressive  
- **Negative Space** – Use space intentionally to reinforce meaning  
- **Hierarchy & Composition** – Guide the viewer’s eye across the layout  
- **Consistency** – Maintain a cohesive design style across all three pieces

<h3 style="color: darkred;">📥 Final Submission</h3>

1. A **single PDF file** containing your **sketches** for all four compositions  
   - **Naming:** `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech4-Sketches.pdf`

2. **Two separate PDF files**, one for each **final composition**  
   - **Naming:**  
     - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech4-1.pdf`  
     - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech4-2.pdf`

> 📌 **Failure to follow document setup or naming instructions may result in a grade deduction.**
