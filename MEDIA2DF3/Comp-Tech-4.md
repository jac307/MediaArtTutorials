<h1 style="color: darkred;">Composition Techniques IV – Typographic Expression</h1>

## Objective

Create **three typographic compositions** that visually express the meaning of selected words by manipulating letterforms. Inspired by **Bruno Munari’s** ideas in *The Shape of Words*, this activity explores how **typographic form, contrast, spacing, distortion, and composition** can be used to visually communicate ideas.

Each composition should:
- Clearly reflect the meaning of the word through visual treatment of type
- Demonstrate conceptual strength and creative experimentation
- Maintain consistency in **quality**, **craft**, and **style** across all three compositions

> 🖥 **Software**: Adobe Illustrator (vector-based visual composition)

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[40–50 min] Tutorial – Recreation Exercise</h3>

### 🔹 Task:
Follow the provided step-by-step tutorial on **expressive typography** to understand how to manipulate letterforms effectively.

📺 **Tutorial**: [Composition Techniques IV Tutorial](#)

- Complete the tutorial **exactly as instructed**
- Export and upload your final document as your **first submission**

📌 **Naming Protocol**: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIV-Tutorial.pdf`  
> ⚠️ **Important**: Make sure you follow the document setup instructions to avoid losing points.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[15–20 min] Sketching – Concept Development</h3>

### 🔹 Task:  
Choose **three words** that you will explore through typographic design.  
Create **three sketches**—one for each word—conceptualizing how you will convey its meaning visually.

### 🎯 Use the following references and techniques:
- **Munari’s The Shape of Words** – Think about how letterforms can reflect meaning  
- **Visual Weight** – Bold vs. light, dense vs. open  
- **Visual Direction** – Flow, alignment, movement  
- **Design Principles** – Wong’s Principles (e.g., contrast, repetition, gradation) or Gestalt Principles (e.g., proximity, continuity, figure/ground)

> 💡 Tip: Consider how the **form of the word enhances the meaning**. For example, the word “fall” might descend diagonally, or “sharp” could use angular cuts.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[Rest of Class] Execute</h3>

### 🔹 Task: Create Your Final Compositions

Set up your Illustrator document with the following settings:
- **Size**: Tabloid (horizontal layout)  
- **Color Mode**: RGB  
- **Artboards**: 3 (one per word)

### 🎨 Design Requirements:
- Use **Adobe Illustrator** to build your final compositions
- Present **three variations** per word (as done in the tutorial)
- Letterforms must be **manually modified**  
  - ❌ Avoid decorative fonts that already express meaning (e.g., don’t use a dripping font for “melting”)  
  - ✅ Instead, **design meaning through form**

### 💡 Things to Consider:
- ✅ **Legibility vs. Expression** – Ensure the word is still readable while expressive  
- ✅ **Negative Space** – Use space intentionally to reinforce meaning  
- ✅ **Hierarchy & Composition** – Guide the viewer’s eye across the layout  
- ✅ **Consistency** – Maintain a cohesive design style across all three pieces

> If using images or textures, make sure they are **embedded** in the Illustrator file.
