In this session, your group will collaboratively plan and prototype your composition using sketches and digital tools. You will explore **form, repetition, and composition**, and prepare your files for laser-cutting using **Inkscape**, the required software for the Thode Makerspace.

> ⏱️ *The final hour of class will take place at the Thode Makerspace for mandatory in-person training.*

## 🧠 Brainstorming & Concept Sketching (20–30 min)

Start by generating ideas as a group. Focus on **Wong’s Elements of Two-Dimensional Design** and the theme of **Form through Repetition**.

### Your sketch must:
- Include **at least 30 individual planes** arranged over a **base of minimum 20 × 20 cm**.
- Apply at least one of the following design principles:  
  *Similarity, Gradation, Anomaly, Contrast, Concentration, Texture*.
- Define the **shape**, **size**, and **spacing** of each plane.
- Show variation in **height**, **depth**, and **angle**.
- Include a **colour scheme** that uses contrast or gradation.
- Plan for potential **connectors or supports** between planes.

> 📏 You will be provided with **birchwood plates** (24 × 12 in, 0.3 in thick). Each group may use up to **3 plates**, charged to your **School of the Arts account**.

## 💻 Digital Vector Setup in Inkscape (45–60 min)

Use **Inkscape** to convert your sketch into vector files for laser cutting. This work must be done in class with the support of your instructor.

### Guidelines:
- Follow the provided **Inkscape setup tutorial** carefully.
- Create a separate layer for each plane if needed.
- Make sure your file is in the correct format (vector paths only, no fills).
- Align your design to fit within the size limits of the birchwood plates (24 × 12 in per sheet).
- Save your file as **.SVG** and label it clearly with your group name and version.

> ⚠️ Inkscape is mandatory, as it is the only format supported by the Thode laser cutter.

## 🧪 Last Hour: In-Person Training at Thode Makerspace

During the final hour of this class session, we will walk as a group to the **Thode Makerspace**. You will receive a **required safety and equipment orientation**, including:

- Machine operation overview  
- Material safety guidelines  
- File upload and print preparation  
- Questions and file checks with staff

> ✅ You must complete the **online Thode Makerspace training modules** on **Avenue to Learn** *before* this session to participate.

## ✅ Before Next Class

- Finish your **vector files** and upload them to the shared folder before your group’s assigned laser-cutting session.
- Double-check all measurements and materials.
- Come prepared for **Part 2 – Colour Planning & Final Assembly**.
