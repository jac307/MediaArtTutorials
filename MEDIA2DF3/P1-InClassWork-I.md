> ⚠️ You must complete the **online Thode Makerspace training modules** on **Avenue to Learn** *before* this session to participate in laser-cutting.

In this session, your group will collaboratively **plan and prototype** a three-dimensional composition using sketches and digital tools. You will explore **form, repetition, and spatial relationships**, and prepare your designs for **laser-cutting using Inkscape**—the required software for the Thode Makerspace.

> ⏱️ *The final hour of class will take place at the Thode Makerspace for mandatory in-person training.*

<h2 style="color: darkred;">[20–30 min] Brainstorming & Concept Sketching</h2>

Work together to generate ideas for your composition, inspired by **Wong’s Elements of Two-Dimensional Design** and sculptural principles of **form through repetition**.

### Your group sketch must:
- Include **20–30 individual planes** arranged over a defined **base**.
  > You will be provided with **birchwood plates** (24 × 12 in, 0.3 in thick). Each group may use up to **4 plates**, charged to your **McMaster School of the Arts account**.
- Apply at least one of the following design principles:  
  *Similarity, Gradation, Anomaly, Contrast, Concentration, Texture*.
- Clearly define the **shape**, **dimensions**, and **spacing** of each plane.
- Incorporate variation in **height**, **depth**, and **angle**.
- Propose a **colour scheme** based on contrast and/or gradation.
- Identify potential **connectors or supports** between planes.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">[45–60 min] Digital Vector Setup in Inkscape</h2>

Use **Inkscape** to transform your sketch into vector-ready files for laser-cutting.

### What is Inkscape?

**Inkscape** is a free, open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator. It allows you to design using precise **paths**, making it ideal for digital fabrication.

While we are using Inkscape because it is **required by the Thode Makerspace**, learning to adapt to different software platforms is a valuable skill for any media artist.  
Being proficient across both proprietary and open-source tools strengthens your ability to work in a variety of **production environments**, from galleries to labs to community-based studios.

### Setup Guidelines:
- **Divide tasks** evenly among group members.
- Follow the **step-by-step Inkscape tutorial** provided in class.
- Use only **vector paths** (no fills or strokes).
- Each birchwood plate must be represented in a **separate document** sized 24 × 12 in.
- Arrange and align all elements to maximize material use.
- Save files as **.SVG**, named as:  
  `Group-#-Plate-1.svg`, `Group-#-Plate-2.svg`, etc.

> ⚠️ Inkscape is mandatory, as it is the only format accepted by the laser-cutting equipment at Thode Makerspace.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">🛠️ Final Hour: In-Person Training at Thode Makerspace</h2>

During the final hour of class, we will walk together to the **Thode Makerspace** for a **required in-person orientation**. This session includes:

- Equipment and laser-cutting overview  
- Material handling and safety procedures  
- File preparation and submission protocol  
- Individual file checks and Q&A with Makerspace staff

---

<h3 style="color: darkred;">📥 Submission</h3>

1. Group brainstorming notes and sketches
   - **Naming Protocol**: `Group-#-Notes.pdf`

2. Two **Individual** Submission
   - **File naming:** `Group-#-Plate-1.svg`, `Group-#-Plate-2.svg`, etc.
     - Double-check all **measurements**, **spacing**, and **layer organization**.

Review the **required materials list** for Part 2 and bring them to the next class.

> 📌 **Failure to follow document setup or naming instructions may result in a grade deduction.**
