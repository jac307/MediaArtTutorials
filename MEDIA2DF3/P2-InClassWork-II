## Objective

In this session, students will continue developing their compositions and begin planning their final exhibition layout.  
Each student will finalize their **two individual compositions**, and each pair will collaborate on the layout strategy for presentation.

**Software**:  
- Adobe Illustrator (primary tool for composition)  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use the Image Trace tool** in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Adobe Photoshop (optional, for textures and image optimization only)

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[1h‚Äì1h30m] Finalizing Digital Compositions</h3>

Continue developing your digital compositions based on your sketches from Part 1.  
Make refinements and add final details using Illustrator.  
Photoshop or Procreate may be used **only** for textures, effects, or image enhancements.

Each student must complete **at least 90%** of their **second** realistic or figurative composition before the next class.

### Document Setup:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure you follow the document setup instructions to avoid losing points.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[30 min] Exhibition Layout & Assembly Planning</h3>

Each pair will begin planning their layout for the final exhibition. Discuss the visual presentation of your four-piece composition as a unified display.

### Consider the Following:
- **Framing/Border Thickness**: Should be consistent or intentionally varied  
- **Spacing Between Pieces**: Balanced visual spacing enhances clarity  
- **Overall Arrangement**: Explore grid-based or freeform layout  
- **Labels or Contextual Text** (optional): Think about minimal descriptions, titles, or captions  
- **Mounting Materials**: Reuse what you have from Project 1 or purchase foam boards (e.g., Dry-Erase Foam Boards from Dollarama)

**Final Print Size**: Each composition must measure **6‚Äì8 inches** on its **longest side** (either width or height)

### Group Submission Requirement:
Create a simple PDF with notes on your layout plan, material list, and arrangement ideas.  
Include a rough sketch or mock-up if helpful.
