In this session, you will move from digital preparation to **material production and colour design**. Each group will:
- Finalize and print their components using the **laser cutter** at the Thode Makerspace.
- Develop and mix a **custom gradient-based colour scheme** using **HSV principles** and **primary pigments** only.

> 🎯 Your goal is to create a consistent and visually engaging **gradient transition** across your composition—no texture is allowed.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">⏳ Laser Cutting Session (45–60 min)</h2>

Each group will meet their scheduled appointment at the **Thode Makerspace** to complete the laser-cutting of their designs.

### Reminders:
- Bring your **prepared Inkscape (.SVG) files** and check formatting with staff before printing.
- Carefully handle and collect your cut birchwood pieces.
- Keep track of any small components or connectors.
- Ensure **clean edges**—light sanding may be required before painting.

> ⚠️ Groups that miss their appointment will be responsible for rescheduling directly with the Makerspace and may delay their project progress.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">🎨 Colour Mixing & Gradient Design (45–60 min)</h2>

Once cutting is complete, your group will begin planning and **mixing the colours** for your final composition.

### Colour Mixing Rules:
- You may use only: **red, yellow, blue, white, and black**.
- All colours must be **mixed by hand**—no pre-mixed paints allowed.
- Store colours in labeled containers (provided in class).

### Gradient Requirements:
- You must apply **colour gradients** across your composition—no solid or flat fills.
- Gradients can be:
  - Simple (e.g., one colour fading to another)
  - Complex (e.g., multi-stop or rainbow gradients)
- All gradients must be designed using **HSV values** (Hue, Saturation, Value):
  - **Hue:** adjust for colour change across the form
  - **Saturation:** control intensity
  - **Value:** define light-to-dark transitions

> 🖌️ **Texture is not allowed**—the emphasis is on colour interaction and flow.

---

### Tips for Successful Colour Design:
- Mix **small test batches** before committing to full sets.
- Plan your gradient transitions on paper before applying to wood.
- Keep brush strokes smooth and consistent.
- Apply **2–3 layers** as needed for even coverage.
- Allow layers to fully dry between applications.

## ✅ Before Next Class

- Finish all colour mixing and label each final tone.
- Upload a photo of your **final colour palette + HSV breakdown** to Avenue to Learn.
- Make sure all your cut shapes are complete and organized for assembly.
- Come prepared for **Part 3 – Final Assembly & Submission**.
