> ⚠️ You must complete the setup of your **Inkscape documents** *before* this session to participate in the laser-cutting session.

In this session, you will move from digital preparation to **material production and colour design**. Each group will:
- Print their components using the **laser cutter** at the Thode Makerspace.
- Sand and prep their birchwood shapes
- Mix a **custom gradient-based colour palette** using **HSV principles** and **primary pigments only**

> Your goal is to create a consistent and visually engaging **gradient transition** across your composition—no texture is allowed.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Laser Cutting Session (45–60 min)</h2>

Each group will meet their scheduled appointment at the **Thode Makerspace** to complete the laser-cutting of their designs.

### Reminders:
- Bring your **prepared Inkscape (.SVG) files** and check formatting with staff before printing.
- Carefully handle and collect your cut birchwood pieces.
- Keep track of any small components or connectors.
- Ensure **clean edges**—light sanding may be required before painting.

> ⚠️ Groups that miss their appointment will be responsible for rescheduling directly with the Makerspace and may delay their project progress.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Surface Prep & White Base Coat (20–30 min)</h2>

After cutting and collecting your pieces, your group must prepare the surfaces for painting.

### Required Steps:
- Use **fine grit sandpaper** to lightly sand all birchwood pieces.  
  > Focus on removing burn marks, splinters, and any uneven edges caused by the laser cutter.
- Once sanded, apply a **solid white base coat** to each shape.  
  > This primer layer ensures brightness and consistency in your final colours.

> ⚠️ Do not skip this step. Groups will lose points if visible imperfections or inconsistent colour coverage are observed in the final exhibition.

Allow the white base coat to **fully dry** before moving to colour mixing.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Colour Mixing & Gradient Design (45–60 min)</h2>

After prepping your pieces, your group will design a **gradient effect across your entire composition**, using **solid colours** assigned **one per plane** to simulate colour flow and variation.

### Colour Mixing Rules:
- You may use only: **red, yellow, blue, white, and black**
- All colours must be **hand-mixed**—no pre-mixed paints allowed
- Mix your full palette in advance before applying colour to the pieces

### Gradient Strategy:
- Assign each shape a **single solid colour**, arranged to produce a **visible gradient transition**
- You may design:
  - **Linear gradients** (e.g., red to blue)
  - **Multi-step gradients** (e.g., rainbow blends)
- Use **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** to guide your colour shifts:
  - **Hue** → controls colour change
  - **Saturation** → intensity of each step
  - **Value** → brightness and darkness across the range

> ⚠️ Do not paint blended gradients directly onto the wood. Each piece must be a **clean solid colour**.

---

### Follow these tips for Successful Colour Design:
- Mix **small test batches** before committing to full sets
- Plan your **gradient transitions on paper** before painting
- You **must** apply a base coat of **white** before any colour
- Keep brush strokes **smooth and consistent**
- Apply **2–3 thin layers** for full, even coverage
- Allow each layer to **fully dry** before continuing
