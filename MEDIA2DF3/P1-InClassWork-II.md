In this session, you will move from digital preparation to **material production and colour design**. Each group will:
- Print their components using the **laser cutter** at the Thode Makerspace.
- Develop and mix a **custom gradient-based colour scheme** using **HSV principles** and **primary pigments** only.

> Your goal is to create a consistent and visually engaging **gradient transition** across your composition—no texture is allowed.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Laser Cutting Session (45–60 min)</h2>

Each group will meet their scheduled appointment at the **Thode Makerspace** to complete the laser-cutting of their designs.

### Reminders:
- Bring your **prepared Inkscape (.SVG) files** and check formatting with staff before printing.
- Carefully handle and collect your cut birchwood pieces.
- Keep track of any small components or connectors.
- Ensure **clean edges**—light sanding may be required before painting.

> ⚠️ Groups that miss their appointment will be responsible for rescheduling directly with the Makerspace and may delay their project progress.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">🎨 Colour Mixing & Gradient Design (45–60 min)</h2>

After cutting, your group will design a **gradient effect across your entire composition**, using **solid colours** assigned **one per plane** to simulate colour flow and variation.

### Colour Mixing Rules:
- You may use only: **red, yellow, blue, white, and black**.
- All colours must be **hand-mixed**—no pre-mixed colours.
- Mix your palette in advance before painting any pieces.

### Gradient Strategy:
- Assign each shape a **single solid colour**, arranged to produce a **visible gradient transition** across the composition.
- You may design:
  - **Linear gradients** (e.g., red to blue)
  - **Complex or multi-hue gradients** (e.g., rainbow transitions)
- Use **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** to guide your colour changes:
  - **Hue** → controls the shift in colour
  - **Saturation** → adjusts intensity across steps
  - **Value** → sets brightness and darkness across the range

> **Do not paint blended gradients onto the pieces**. Each plane must be filled with a solid colour.

---

### Tips for Successful Colour Design:
- Mix **small test batches** before committing to full sets.
- Plan your gradient transitions on paper before applying to wood.
- Keep brush strokes smooth and consistent.
- Apply **2–3 layers** as needed for even coverage.
- Allow layers to fully dry between applications.
