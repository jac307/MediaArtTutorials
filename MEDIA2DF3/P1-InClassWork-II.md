> ‚ö†Ô∏è You must complete the setup of your **Inkscape documents** *before* this session to participate in the laser-cutting session.

In this session, you will move from digital preparation to **material production and colour design**. Each group will:
- Print their components using the **laser cutter** at the Thode Makerspace.
- Sand and prep their birchwood shapes
- Mix a **custom gradient-based colour palette** using **HSV principles** and **primary pigments only**

> Your goal is to create a consistent and visually engaging **gradient transition** across your composition ‚Äîno texture is allowed.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Laser Cutting Session (45‚Äì60 min)</h2>

Each group will meet their scheduled appointment at the **Thode Makerspace** to complete the laser-cutting of their designs.

### Reminders:
- The instructor will be present during these sessions.  
- üì§ You must upload your **ready-to-print files** to **Avenue to Learn** by the required deadline.
- Carefully handle and collect your cut birchwood pieces.
- Keep track of any small components or connectors.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Groups that miss their appointment will be responsible for rescheduling directly with the Makerspace and may delay their project progress.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Surface Prep & White Base Coat</h2>

After cutting and collecting your pieces, your group must prepare the surfaces for painting.

### Required Steps:
- Use **fine grit sandpaper** to lightly sand all birchwood pieces.  
  > Focus on removing burn marks, splinters, and any uneven edges caused by the laser cutter.
- Once sanded, clean them and apply a **solid white base coat** to each shape.  
  > This primer layer ensures brightness and consistency in your final colours.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not skip this step. Groups will lose points if visible imperfections or inconsistent colour coverage are observed in the final exhibition.

Allow the white base coat to **fully dry** before moving to colour application.

<h2 style="color: darkred;">Colour Mixing & Gradient Design</h2>

After prepping your pieces, your group will applied your **gradient effect across your entire composition**, using **solid colours** assigned **one per plane** to simulate colour flow and variation.

### Colour Mixing Rules:
- You may use only: **red, yellow, blue, white, and black**
- All colours must be **hand-mixed**‚Äîno pre-mixed paints allowed
- Mix your full palette in advance before applying colour to the pieces
- Mix **enough paint for at least 2‚Äì3 coats** per shape.  
- Store your mixed colours in the **required labeled containers** for later use and touch-ups.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not paint blended gradients directly onto the wood. Each piece must be a **clean solid colour**.

### Follow these tips for Successful Colour Design:
- Mix **small test batches** before committing to full sets
- Plan your **gradient transitions on paper** before painting
- You **must** apply a base coat of **white** before any colour
- Keep brush strokes **smooth and consistent**
- Apply **2‚Äì3 thin layers** for full, even coverage
- Allow each layer to **fully dry** before continuing
