<h1 style="color: darkred;">P1 ‚Äì Final Submission: Color Painting, Assembling & Exhibition</h1>  
*Project 1 ‚Äì In Groups of 3 or 4 students*

---

This is a **physical, in-person submission**. Each group will present their completed birchwood composition as part of the **Class Exhibition**.

Final marks will reflect your attention to:

- Craftsmanship and colour execution (smooth finishes, clean gradients)
- Consistency and alignment across shapes
- Laser-cutting precision and structural assembly
- Participation in the final exhibition and care in presentation

---

## üé® Painting & Assembly Guidelines

Your group must:

- Apply **solid colours** to each shape to produce a **gradient effect across the composition**
- Use **only hand-mixed paints** from **primary colours, white, and black**
- Follow your HSV-based palette plan submitted in Part 2

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Visible brush strokes, uneven finishes, or unpainted sides will result in **grade deductions**.

### Painting Protocol:
- Paint each shape **white first** before applying colour
- Use **2‚Äì3 thin, even layers** of colour
- Let paint **dry completely** between layers
- Ensure **consistency of colour progression and tone** across all pieces

### Assembly Instructions:
- Assemble your structure following your sketch plan
- Use **minimal glue** and ensure secure connections
- Keep spacing, layering, and alignment consistent and intentional

## üñºÔ∏è Exhibition Setup (in class)

You will install your final group project during our **Class Exhibition Session**.

### Display Requirements:
- Your piece must be **fully assembled and dry**
- You must mount or display your work in a way that:
  - Prevents damage or tipping
  - Communicates your gradient design and structure clearly

> You may use optional supports (cardboard base, plinth, foam board) as long as they don‚Äôt obstruct or overpower the piece.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Late or incomplete assembly will affect your grade.
