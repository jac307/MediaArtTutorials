# MEDIA 2DF3

This studio-based course introduces students to the fundamentals of visual design through weekly hands-on exercises and guided projects. Working with both digital and physical tools, students develop skills in composition, colour theory, typography, and layout using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.  

The course draws from core design concepts introduced in *Design as Art* by Bruno Munari and *Elements of Design* by Wucius Wong, and gradually applies them through practical assignments focused on two-dimensional design, Gestalt principles, and expressive typography.  
The course concludes with a public exhibition of student work.

> Linked tutorials are accessible only while the course is in session.
