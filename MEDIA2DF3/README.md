# MEDIA 2DF3

This studio-based course introduces students to the core principles of visual design through hands-on projects using both digital and physical tools. Students will learn to apply design fundamentals—such as shape, form, colour, texture, repetition, and balance—through weekly exercises and guided instruction.  
Working primarily in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, students will build skills in vector illustration, image editing, colour palette creation, and layout design. The course begins with foundational concepts from Design as Art by Bruno Munari and Elements of Design by Wucius Wong, progressing into more advanced applications of two-dimensional design, Gestalt principles, and typographic composition.  
The course concludes with a public exhibition of student work, where students will mount and present their final projects.
