## Objective

Create **three digital compositions**, each combining **two different Gestalt Principles of Design** from the list below:  
1. Proximity  
2. Similarity  
3. Continuity  
4. Closure  
5. Figure/Ground  
6. Pr√§gnanz

<img src="imgs/20.png" style="width: 50vw; height: auto;">

Each composition should demonstrate how the selected principles interact to affect **form**, **structure**, and **visual perception**.  
Use what you‚Äôve learned so far (e.g., layout, grids, colour theory, texture) along with the **new Gestalt concepts and examples** introduced in class to produce designs that are **intentional**, **engaging**, and **format-aware**.

## Software** 
- **Adobe Illustrator** (vector-based) ‚Äì for general layout, shapes, and composition setup  
- **Adobe Photoshop** (pixel-based) ‚Äì for textures, photomontage, or image-based enhancements

## Activities  
**Complete the following activities in order. Ask your professor for help if needed.**

---

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[15‚Äì20 min] Sketching</h3>

You may sketch using a **digital or physical notebook**.  
According to Wikipedia, a sketch is ‚Äúa rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work.‚Äù

#### Task:
- Sketch **three compositions** (one per format), each combining **two different Gestalt principles** from the list above.
- Explore how these principles interact visually to create structure and meaning.

#### Composition Formats (Choose one per sketch):
- **Graphic Design** ‚Üí Logo or Poster  
- **UI Design** ‚Üí One-page website mockup or App intro + second screen  
- **Photomontage** ‚Üí A photographic composition using collage and texture  

#### Focus on:
- Artistic experimentation ‚Äì explore **unexpected visual relationships**  
- Communication ‚Äì ensure Gestalt principles support **clarity and impact**  
- Negative space and layering ‚Äì enhance **visual hierarchy**  
- Viewer experience ‚Äì guide the eye and create **unity in complexity**  
- Colour & contrast ‚Äì use them to support perceptual grouping and focus  

> Ask the professor for feedback during sketching!

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[15 min] Setup</h3>

Set up your documents in **Adobe Illustrator** and/or **Photoshop** based on the format of each composition.  
You must follow the appropriate setup tutorial and use correct **file naming** conventions.

---

### Graphic Design (Logo or Poster)  

- **Primary Software**: Adobe Illustrator
- **Optional**: Adobe Photoshop (for prepping raster images)
- **Naming Protocol**: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech3-1.ai`
- Don‚Äôt forget to **embed all linked images**.

#### Follow these tutorials to properly set up your document

#### Recommended tutorials

---

### UI/UX Design (Website or App Screens)  

- **Primary Software**: Adobe Illustrator
- **Optional**: Adobe Photoshop (for preparing assets/images)
- **Naming Protocol**: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech3-2.ai`
- Don‚Äôt forget to **embed all linked images**.

#### Follow these tutorials to properly set up your document

---

### Photomontage  

- **Primary Software**: Adobe Photoshop
- **Optional**: Adobe Illustrator ((for preparing or exporting vector-based elements)
- **Naming Protocol**: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTech3-2.psd`

#### Follow these tutorials to properly set up your document

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[Rest of class] Execute</h3>

### üõ†Ô∏è Create Your Compositions

Ask yourself as you work:
- Are the **Gestalt principles clearly integrated** and visually understandable?
- Does the composition **guide the viewer‚Äôs eye** effectively?
- Are **form, space, contrast, and balance** working together harmoniously?
- Does the final output align with your **sketch and chosen format**?

### üíæ Save and Export

Export each completed composition as an **Adobe PDF (.pdf)**  
üìå **Naming Protocol**:  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-1.pdf`  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-2.pdf`  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-3.pdf`  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your exported PDFs are **sharp**, **correctly coloured**, and **include all embedded images**.

---

<h3 style="color: darkred;">üì• Final Submission</h3>

Submit the following:

1. A **single PDF** file containing your **three sketches**  
   - Naming: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-Sketches.pdf`

2. **Three final compositions** as separate PDF files  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-1.pdf`  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-2.pdf`  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-3.pdf`

3. **Two-sentence description for each composition**  
   - Post directly into **Avenue to Learn** (not as a file)  
   - Each description must briefly explain the concept and identify the Gestalt principles used  

üìå **Example**:  
> "This composition explores urban isolation through the use of Figure/Ground and Continuity. The contrast between overlapping silhouettes and blurred cityscapes emphasizes the fragmented experience of city life."

> ‚ùó **Follow submission and naming instructions carefully to avoid losing points.**
