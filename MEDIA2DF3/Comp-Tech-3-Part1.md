<h1 style="color: darkred;">Composition Techniques III – Part 1</h1>

## Objective

Create **three digital compositions**, each combining **two different Gestalt Principles of Design** from the list below:  
1. Proximity  
2. Similarity  
3. Continuity  
4. Closure  
5. Figure/Ground  
6. Prägnanz  

Each composition should demonstrate how the selected principles interact to affect **form**, **structure**, and **visual perception**.  
Use what you’ve learned so far (e.g., layout, grids, colour theory, texture) along with the **new Gestalt concepts and examples** introduced in class to produce designs that are **intentional**, **engaging**, and **format-aware**.

> 🖥 Software: Adobe Illustrator (vector-based) & Adobe Photoshop (pixel-based, textures/montage)

## Activities  
**Complete the following activities in order. Ask your professor for help if needed.**

---

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[15–20 min] Sketching</h3>

According to Wikipedia, a sketch is “a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work.”

### 🔹 Task:
- Sketch **three compositions** (one per format), each combining **two different Gestalt principles** from the list above.
- Explore how these principles interact visually to create structure and meaning.

### 🎨 Composition Formats (Choose one per sketch):
- **Graphic Design** → Logo or Poster  
- **UI Design** → One-page website mockup or App intro + second screen  
- **Photomontage** → A photographic composition using collage and texture  

### 💡 Focus on:
- Artistic experimentation – explore **unexpected visual relationships**  
- Communication – ensure Gestalt principles support **clarity and impact**  
- Negative space and layering – enhance **visual hierarchy**  
- Viewer experience – guide the eye and create **unity in complexity**  
- Colour & contrast – use them to support perceptual grouping and focus  

> 🔍 Ask the professor for feedback during sketching!

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[Rest of class] Execute</h3>

### 🛠️ Create Your Compositions

Ask yourself as you work:
- Are the **Gestalt principles clearly integrated** and visually understandable?
- Does the composition **guide the viewer’s eye** effectively?
- Are **form, space, contrast, and balance** working together harmoniously?
- Does the final output align with your **sketch and chosen format**?

### 💾 Save and Export

Export each completed composition as an **Adobe PDF (.pdf)**  
📌 **Naming Protocol**:  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-1.pdf`  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-2.pdf`  
- `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-3.pdf`  

> ⚠️ Make sure your exported PDFs are **sharp**, **correctly coloured**, and **include all embedded images**.

---

<h3 style="color: darkred;">📥 Final Submission</h3>

Submit the following:

1. A **single PDF** file containing your **three sketches**  
   - Naming: `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-Sketches.pdf`

2. **Three final compositions** as separate PDF files  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-1.pdf`  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-2.pdf`  
   - `Lastname-Firstname-CompTechIII-3.pdf`

3. **Two-sentence description for each composition**  
   - Post directly into **Avenue to Learn** (not as a file)  
   - Each description must briefly explain the concept and identify the Gestalt principles used  

📌 **Example**:  
> "This composition explores urban isolation through the use of Figure/Ground and Continuity. The contrast between overlapping silhouettes and blurred cityscapes emphasizes the fragmented experience of city life."

> ❗ **Follow submission and naming instructions carefully to avoid losing points.**
