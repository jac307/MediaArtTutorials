## 🖼️ Exhibition Preparation (before the Class Exhibition)

Start preparing your layout **before** the printing session. You will mount your work for display during the final exhibition.

### Print Size:
- Each composition should measure **6–8 inches** on the **longest side**
- **Maintain the same aspect ratio** in all of your compositions for consistency.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Follow all setup and submission instructions carefully to avoid losing points.

### Mounting Guidelines:

- You are responsible for mounting your printed compositions for the final exhibition  
- You may use **any external materials** for mounting, such as **Dry-Erase Foam Boards** (available at Dollarama), cardstock, or other creative supports  
- Keep spacing and framing **consistent** across all four pieces  
- Use the **same aspect ratio** and align your pieces carefully 

> **Be creative!** Your mounting choices—such as layout, layering, or added textures—can visually reinforce the **theme or characteristics** of your animal.  
> Consider how the animal’s **movement, behaviour, or environment** might influence how your work is presented.  
> Let your final display **tell a story** and serve as a cohesive visual statement.
