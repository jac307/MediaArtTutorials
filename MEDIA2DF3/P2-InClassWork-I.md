## Objective

Students will collaborate in **pairs** to create a **series of four compositions**, each offering a different visual interpretation of an assigned sea animal.

Each student will individually produce **two compositions**, ensuring a diverse range of styles‚Äîfrom **abstraction** to **figurative** to **realistic**.

The final works will be assembled together in a structured layout and showcased in an open exhibition.

**Software**:  
- Adobe Illustrator (primary tool for composition)  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use the Image Trace tool** in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Adobe Photoshop (optional, for textures and image optimization only)

---

## Composition Breakdown

Each pair must create four compositions:

1. **Realistic Representation** (1 composition)  
   - Accurate and detailed rendering  
   - Focus on anatomy, texture, and shading  

2. **Figurative/Illustrative Interpretation** (1 composition)  
   - Stylized or expressive but still recognizable  
   - Can include collage or digital illustration

3. **Abstract Representations** (2 compositions)  
   - Geometric or minimalistic  
   - Inspired by **Gestalt principles**, **negative space**, or **shape simplification**

> Each student creates one abstract composition and either the realistic or figurative piece. Decide this collaboratively. You must **maintain the same aspect ratio** in all of your compositions to ensure visual consistency across the project.

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[30‚Äì45 min] Sketching & Planning</h3>

Before jumping into digital work, students will complete a guided **brainstorming session** and begin sketching.

### Brainstorming Questions:
- **Understanding the Animal**:
  - What are its key characteristics? (Shape, movement, texture, colour, patterns)
  - What makes it visually unique?

- **Style Exploration**:
  - What techniques are best for realistic/figurative representation?
  - How can it be simplified into geometric/abstract form?

- **Collaboration & Unity**:
  - What will visually connect your four compositions?
  - Will you share a colour palette, framing, or background style?
  - How will your pieces be displayed together?

### Group Submission Requirement:
Each pair must submit a brainstorming document that includes:  
- Answers to the questions above  
- A short summary (3‚Äì5 sentences) describing the group‚Äôs artistic direction  
- Rough sketches of all four compositions (2 per student)  
- Colour palette considerations  

**üì§ Group Submission**. **Naming Protocol**: `Group-#-Notes.pdf`

<h3 style="color: darkred;">[Remaining Time] Start First Digital Composition</h3>

Each student begins working on either the **realistic** or **figurative** composition in **Adobe Illustrator**.  
Photoshop may be used for minor **texture or image effects** only.  

Each student must complete **at least 80%** of their realistic or figurative composition before the next class.

### Document Setup:



**Your Illustrator document must include the following settings:**
- **Units:** Inches  
- **6‚Äì8 inches** on its **longest side** (either width or height)
- **Bleed:** 0.3 in (on all sides)
- **Color Mode:** RGB
- **Raster Effects:** High (300 PPI)  

> **Maintain the same aspect ratio** in all of your compositions to ensure visual consistency across the project.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure you follow the document setup instructions to avoid losing points.
