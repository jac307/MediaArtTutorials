<h1 style="color: darkred;">Project 2 – Morphologies</h1> 
*In Pairs with Individual Work*

---

## Overview

In this project, students will work in **pairs** to create a **series of four digital compositions** that explore different visual interpretations of a sea animal. Each student will produce **two compositions individually**: one abstract and one either realistic or figurative.  

Compositions will range in style from **abstraction** to **realism**, challenging students to apply formal design principles and techniques across varied representational modes. The final project will be showcased in a public exhibition.

> **The assigned sea animal will be announced in class.**  
> **Animal selection will happen through a randomized draw, in class.**
