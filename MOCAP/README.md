## Motion Capture with Perception Neuron 3

[**Perception Neuron 3 (PN3)**](https://www.noitom.com/perception-neuron-3) is a wireless, full-body motion capture system known for its compact size and portability. It uses **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** sensors to track body movement and is designed to function in a variety of environments—**no need for special lighting or camera setups**.

PN3 is part of the broader **Perception Neuron family**, including Perception Neuron Studio, and is widely used in:
- Game development 🎮  
- Film and animation 🎬  
- Dance and performance art 💃  
- Virtual production 🧑‍💻  
- Military, medical, and sports training 🪖🏥🏃  

Its user-friendly software, **Axis Studio**, allows for real-time body tracking and easy export of motion data in **BVH (Biovision Hierarchy)** or **FBX** formats.

In this series of tutorials, you will learn how to **record your own movements using Axis Studio and retarget them onto your 3D character in Blender**.

## 🎥 What is Motion Capture?

**Motion capture (or mocap)** is a technology that records the movement of real-world bodies—typically human performers—and translates that movement into digital data. This data is then applied to virtual characters or objects, allowing them to move in realistic or stylized ways. You can use it in:

- Animation in **films** and **video games**  
- **Live performance** and digital puppetry  
- **Virtual production** and cinematography  
- **Medical**, **sports**, and **military** analysis  
- **Experimental art**, **dance**, and **installation**
