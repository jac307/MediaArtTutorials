# üßçüßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Perception Neuron 3 (PN3) ‚Äì Posture Calibration in Axis Studio

---

## üîç What is Body Calibration?

**Body calibration** is the process of aligning the motion capture system with the user‚Äôs physical body to ensure accurate tracking. During calibration, the software creates a digital skeleton that matches the performer‚Äôs proportions and posture, enabling clean motion data. It‚Äôs a crucial first step before recording or streaming mocap data.

#### B
- Keep your hands clasped in front of your body, fingers parallel to the ground, and the angle between thumb and fingers is about 45 degrees.

### 4. ‚úÖ Confirm Calibration
- Once finished, Axis Studio will show a **success notification**.
- You‚Äôll see the virtual avatar match your body posture in real time.
- If the avatar looks distorted or offset, **repeat the calibration** or adjust sensor positions.

---

### 5. üß™ Test Motion
- Walk around or perform a few simple gestures.
- Confirm that movements are tracking smoothly and accurately.

## üìù Tips
- **Recalibrate** anytime sensors are moved or tracking appears off.
- Use **tight straps** and correct **sensor placement** for best results.
- If you're using multiple users, calibrate for **each individual body**.
