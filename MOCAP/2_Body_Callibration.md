# 🧍🧍‍♂️ Perception Neuron 3 (PN3) – Posture Calibration in Axis Studio

---

## 🔍 What is Body Calibration?

**Body calibration** is the process of aligning the motion capture system with the user’s physical body to ensure accurate tracking. During calibration, the software creates a digital skeleton that matches the performer’s proportions and posture, enabling clean motion data. It’s a crucial first step before recording or streaming mocap data.

- If the avatar looks distorted or offset, **repeat the calibration** or adjust sensor positions.

---

### 5. 🧪 Test Motion
- Walk around or perform a few simple gestures.
- Confirm that movements are tracking smoothly and accurately.

---

## 📝 Tips
- **Recalibrate** anytime sensors are moved or tracking appears off.
- Use **tight straps** and correct **sensor placement** for best results.
- If you're using multiple users, calibrate for **each individual body**.
