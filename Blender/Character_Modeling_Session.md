# 🧱 Character Modeling Session  
**Time:** 10:20–10:45 AM // 1:00–2:30 PM

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Begin building your character in Blender using one of the two modeling approaches below:

---

## First, Review Your Sketch (2–3 min)

- Look at your creature drawing and shape breakdown.  
- Ask yourself: **Is my character more geometric or more organic/humanoid?**  
  - If it's made of clear shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) → **Go to Path 🅰️**
  - If it looks more like a person or creature with limbs → **Go to Path 🅱️**

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use **Path A** if your character is geometric or made of bold parts.  
- Use **Path B** if your character has a body with limbs or curved shapes.  
- Stay low-poly — don’t worry about detail right now.  
- Ask for help choosing a method or applying a modifier.

## 🅰️ Path A: **Geometric Modeling with Basic Shapes + Modifiers**

> Best for: **Robots, abstract beings, simple creatures**

### 🖍️ Step 1: Review Your Sketch 
- Look at your creature drawing and shape breakdown.  
- What’s the main body shape? Where do you want to start?

---

### 🧱 Step 2: Add Your First Shape  
- Open Blender  
- Delete the default cube if needed  
- Add a base mesh: `Shift + A → Mesh → (Sphere / Cube / Cylinder)`   
- Add more parts (head, arms, legs) using new shapes

### Step 3: Use Modifiers & Tools (✨New Options)

| Tool                      | Shortcut               | Use for...                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Add Object                | `Shift + A`            | Add basic shapes               |
| Move / Rotate / Scale     | `G` / `R` / `S`        | Place and transform objects    |
| Join Objects              | `Ctrl + J`             | Combine multiple meshes        |
| Shade Smooth              | Right-click            | Soften surface shading         |
| Snap Tool                 | Shift + Tab            | Align objects easily           |
| ✨Join Objects            | `Ctrl + J`             | Combine multiple meshes        |
| ✨Snap Tool               | Shift + Tab or Toolbar | Make your shape look round     |
| ✨Shade Smooth            | Right-click on mesh    | Align shapes perfectly         |
| ✨Object Origin/Transform | `N` panel or toolbar   | Set pivot for rotation         |

| Modifier              | How to access   | Use for...                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Mirror                | Modifiers Tab   | Build symmetrical characters   |
| Subdivision Surface   | Modifiers Tab   | Smooth rounded shapes          |
| Array                 | Modifiers Tab   | Repeats objects in rows        |
| Boolean               | Modifiers Tab   | Combines or subtracts shapes   |
| Solidify              | Modifiers Tab   | Gives flat shapes a thickness  |
| ✨Wireframe Modifier  | Modifiers Tab   | Start with a line “skeleton”   |

## 🅱️ Path B: **Fast Organic Modeling with the Skin Modifier**

> Best for: **Humanoid or animal-like creatures with limbs**

### Tools You'll Use + Explanations & Tutorials

| Tool                     | Purpose                                                                 | Tutorial |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Add Vertex**           | Use a single point instead of a full shape to start a character's “skeleton.”  | 📺 [How to Add a Single Vertex in Blender](https://youtu.be/KZBCb6EWq0s) (1 min) |
| **Extrude (`E`)**        | Create connected “bones” by pulling out more points from the first vertex. | 📺 [Blender Beginner Tutorial: Extrude](https://youtu.be/qj2nA0Y8Xcg?t=99) (from 1:39) |
| **Skin Modifier**        | Automatically wraps geometry around your skeleton-like structure. Easy for limbs! | 📺 [Skin Modifier Tutorial – Fast Character Base](https://youtu.be/xrHZzMr1qVw) (4 min) |
| **Ctrl + A (Scale Vertices)** | Change the thickness of each “limb” or segment. Useful for different body parts. | (explained in video above) |
| **Mirror Modifier**      | Create symmetry (works with the Skin Modifier too).                       | 📺 [Mirror Modifier Tutorial](https://youtu.be/IT4NBHD3vF4) (2 min) |
| **Subdivision Surface**  | Smooth your final mesh for an organic look.                             | 📺 [Subdivision Modifier Tutorial](https://youtu.be/MnJZCwhz4hE) (2 min) |
| **Shade Smooth**         | Soften the shading on your shape (no extra geometry).                    | 📺 [Shade Smooth vs Flat in Blender](https://youtu.be/npNn6z_OetI) (1 min) |

## 💾 File Saving

- File → Save As  
- **Name it based on your method:**  
  - `YourName_GeoChar.blend` or `YourName_SkinChar.blend`  
- Save to your USB or class folder

---

## ❓ Creative Question

**What shape or pose defines your character?**  
→ Focus on that as your anchor during this first modeling session.
