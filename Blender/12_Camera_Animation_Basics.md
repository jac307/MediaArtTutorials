### Learn how to animate your camera

Watch and **apply** these camera animation techniques in your own scene.  
For each video, **recreate the movement using keyframes**, then render a short preview (5–10 sec).

1. **Basic Camera Pan**  
   🎞️ [Pan Movement Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMzvWfINzpY)  
   → Animate a side-to-side camera slide

2. **Smooth Orbit Around Object**  
   🎞️ [Orbiting a Character or Object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzEPOXax1I)  
   → Rotate the camera around your character

3. **Zoom In or Out**  
   🎞️ [Zoom Camera Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4jPmiVXME4)  
   → Pull camera in or out slowly

> ✅ Apply each type of movement directly in your scene and export a tiny preview (Render → Animation).

## 📝 Reflection Prompt

> How did your camera motion affect the scene?  
> Does it make the moment feel slow, fast, intense, peaceful, or cinematic?
