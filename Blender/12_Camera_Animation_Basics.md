## Learn the basics on how to animate your camera

Watch and **apply** this basic camera animation in your own scene, then export it as a video file.

### **Intro to Camera Animation**: How To Keyframe Camera

### 💾 Export Your Animation

- Go to `Render Properties → Output`
- Set file format: `.FFMPEG video`
- Set resolution: 1920x1080
- Set frame rate: 24 fps
- File → Render → Render Animation  
- Save as `YourName_CameraMove.mp4

## Learn more camera animation techniques

For each video, **recreate the movement using keyframes**, then render a short preview (5–10 sec).

### **Smooth Orbit Around Object**: Rotate the camera around your character

> ✅ Apply each type of movement directly in your scene and export a tiny preview (Render → Animation).

## 📝 Reflection Prompt

> How did your camera motion affect the scene?  
> Does it make the moment feel slow, fast, intense, peaceful, or cinematic?

## ➕ **Extra**  
If you have extra time, try experimenting with object animation!  
Follow the tutorial below in a **separate Blender file** so you don’t affect your main project.
