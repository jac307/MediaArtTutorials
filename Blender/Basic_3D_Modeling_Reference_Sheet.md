# 🧱 Character Modeling Session 1  
**Time:** 10:20–10:45 AM  
**Activity:** Start Building Your 3D Character  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Begin modeling your stylized character in **Blender**.  
You’ll use **Monday’s tools** and some **new ones** to build the **basic structure** of your creature.

---

## 👣 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🖍️ Step 1: Review Your Sketch (2 min)  
- Look at your creature drawing and shape breakdown.  
- What’s the main body shape? Where do you want to start?

---

### 🧱 Step 2: Add Your First Shape (5 min)  
- Open Blender  
- Delete the default cube if needed  
- Add a base mesh: `Shift + A → Mesh → (Sphere / Cube / Cylinder)`  
- Use:
  - `G` to Move  
  - `R` to Rotate  
  - `S` to Scale  
- Add more parts (head, arms, legs) using new shapes
