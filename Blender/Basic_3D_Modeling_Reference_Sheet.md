# 🧱 Basic 3D Modeling Reference Sheet + Planning Activity

**Activity:** Modeling Session 1 – Build Your Stylized Character  
**Time:** 9:30–10:45 AM  
**Location:** Media Arts Lab  
**Software:** Blender  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Translate your sketched character into a 3D model using **simple shapes and transformations** in Blender.

## ✍️ PART 1: From Sketch to Shapes (15–20 min)

### Step 1: Look at Your Creature Sketch  
In your sketchbook or handout, do the following:

**🧠 Identify the basic building blocks:**  
Break your character into geometric parts. Draw and label them.

| Body Part        | Shape (Cube, Sphere, etc.) | Notes |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Head             |                            |       |
| Torso            |                            |       |
| Arms             |                            |       |
| Legs             |                            |       |
| Special Features |                            | (Tail, wings, horns, etc.) |

Add arrows and notes to your drawing that show which **Blender mesh** you’ll use for each part.

## 🖥️ PART 2: Build Your Base Character (20–25 min)

Use the shapes you listed above to start building your character in Blender.  
Use only the tools and modifiers from Monday plus the ones listed here:

### 🔧 Basic Tools & Shortcuts

| Tool               | Shortcut   | What it Does                     |
|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Add Mesh           | `Shift + A`| Add cube, sphere, etc.           |
| Move               | `G`        | Move objects                     |
| Rotate             | `R`        | Rotate parts                     |
| Scale              | `S`        | Resize                           |
| Mirror Modifier    | —          | Create symmetry                  |
| Subdivision Surface| —          | Smooth shape (optional!)         |

**Focus:** Combine shapes and build the structure — don’t worry about fine detail.

---

## ✏️ PART 3: Reflect & Refine on Paper (10–15 min)

Now that your base character is taking shape, go back to your sketch and reflect:

**Which tools can help shape it more clearly?**

| Blender Tool      | What it Could Help You Do           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Join (`Ctrl + J`) | Combine parts into one object       |
| Mirror Modifier   | Keep symmetry between sides         |
| Subdivision       | Add smooth curves                   |
| Snap/Grid         | Line parts up                       |
| Edge Loops (Later)| Add detail in specific places       |

Update your drawing with arrows or notes showing what tools you'd use where.

## 💾 Save Your File  
Save your Blender file to your USB or student folder.  
**File name format:** `YourName_CreatureBase.blend`

## 💡 Creative Prompt  
**How do your shapes tell us something about your character?**  
Are they funny? Fierce? Dreamlike? Keep it simple — but expressive!
