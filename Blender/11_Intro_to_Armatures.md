# 🦴 Intro to Armatures

---

## 🎯 Objective  

**Goal**: Add bones (armatures) to your character, pose them, and create expressive still shots using camera and lighting.

---

## Step 1: Learn the Basics of Armatures

**Open a New Blender File**  
- Go to `File → New → General`  
- Save as: `YourName_ArmaturePractice.blend`

**Watch and follow this tutorial** 

Follow along in Blender and try:
- Adding an armature: `Shift + A → Armature → Single Bone`
- Going into Edit Mode to add more bones (`Tab`)
- Extruding (`E`) to add limbs
- Switching between **Edit**, **Pose**, and **Object** Modes

## Step 2: Add Bones to Your Character

**Open Your Character File**  
- File → Open → `YourName_Character.blend`

🦴 **Add an Armature**
- `Shift + A → Armature → Single Bone`
- Enter **Edit Mode** (`Tab`) to build your skeleton
- Use `E` to extrude more bones (arms, legs, spine, etc.)

Think about the shape of your character:
- Robot or blocky? You may only need a few bones.
- Humanoid or organic? Add a basic spine, arms, and legs.
- Unusual shape? Be creative with the rig!

## Step 3: Pose and Capture Your Character

👾 **Pose Your Character**
- Switch to **Pose Mode**
- Use `R` (rotate) to change bone angles
- Experiment with expressive poses
- ⚠️ For now, just pose your character. **Don’t animate with armatures yet**.

📷 **Set Up a Camera and Lights**
- Add or adjust camera angle and lighting (use earlier guides)

💾 **Render Still Images**
- Use `F12` to render a single shot
- Save as `.png`: `Image → Save As`

🎯 Try rendering 2–3 different poses!

## 💡 Tips
- Keep bones simple—this is just a pose, ⚠️ **not full animation**
- Zoom in/out with `Scroll`, rotate with `Middle Mouse`, pan with `Shift + Middle Mouse`
- Use the **Bone tab** to rename or tweak bones
- If your mesh doesn’t move with the bones, don’t worry—we’re focusing on visual posing for now
