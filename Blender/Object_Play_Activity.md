## ✏️ 1. Sketch First! (10–15 min)

Before you open Blender, sketch your idea on paper. Think about:

- What kind of shape or creature do you want to create?  
- Will it be geometric, organic, or weird?  
- Is it standing, floating, or moving?  
- What’s its mood or purpose?  

_No need to be perfect — just plan your approach!_
