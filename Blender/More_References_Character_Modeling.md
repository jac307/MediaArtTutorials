# üëæ Character Modeling: More references and ways to character model in Blender

---

## Overview

In [üëæ Character Modeling Session 2](9_Character_Modeling_Session_2.md), there are **two main workflows** explored for modeling characters in Blender. These methods introduced core tools like **extrusion**, **modifiers**, and **basic mesh editing**. But remember ‚Äî there‚Äôs no one ‚Äúright‚Äù way to model a character.

Depending on the **type of character** you want to build (blocky, organic, stylized, robotic, etc.), you might choose a different approach. Below are **three alternative tutorials** that demonstrate other character modeling paths. Feel free to **explore these at your own pace**, or use them for future projects!

## Stylized Character from Scratch Using a Reference Image  
**Intermediate** | Uses basic shapes  
Learn to block out a cartoony human figure using simple primitives, guided by a 2D reference image or drawing to keep your character proportions and style consistent.
