# 👾 Character Modeling Session 2: Final Touches & Scene Integration
**Time:** 1h30m
  
🎯 **Goal:** Finish modeling your character, export it, and place it in your environment scene with proper materials and lighting.

---

## Overview

In this session, you’ll finalize your 3D character, **export it as a `.obj` file with materials**, and **import it into your environment scene**. You’ll make sure it fits the space in **scale, position**, and **style**, and begin applying materials and lighting for a unified look.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1️⃣ Finish Modeling Your Character

- Add final **features**: limbs, eyes, accessories, etc.  
- Add **materials** or **basic textures**: skin, metal, clothes, etc.  
- Optional: Use the **Hair Particle System** for simple hair/fur.  
- Save your character file one last time!

---

### 2️⃣ Export Your Character (with Materials)

- File → Export → **Wavefront (.obj)**  
- Check these options:
  - ✅ **Selection Only** (select your character first!)  
  - ✅ **Include Normals**  
  - ✅ **Include Materials**  
- Save as: `YourName_Character.obj`  
- Keep the `.MTL` file and textures in the same folder.

---

### 3️⃣ Open Your Environment File

- Open `YourName_SceneModel.blend`  
- Save as a new version if needed: `YourName_Scene_Final.blend`

---

### 4️⃣ Import Your Character

- File → Import → **Wavefront (.obj)**  
- Find your `.obj` file and import it  
- Select your character and **scale it proportionally**:
  - Use `S` to scale  
  - Use `G` to move it to the right position  
  - Use `R` to rotate if needed

🪄 **Tip:** Your character should match the size of the space (e.g., not taller than the wall or smaller than a bench!).

---

### 5️⃣ Add/Adjust Materials & Lighting

- Go to the **Shading** workspace  
- Add or tweak materials for:
  - Skin, eyes, hair, clothes, etc.  
- In your **Scene File**, add or reposition lights for dramatic effect:
  - Use **Area**, **Point**, or **Sun** lights  
  - Position for shadows, highlights, or mood
  - Adjust strength and color

---

## 💾 Save Frequently!

- File → Save  
- Final name: `YourName_CharacterInScene.blend`  
- Save to your USB or class folder

---

## 🪞 Creative Question

**Does your character feel “at home” in the space you created?**  
→ Think about proportions, lighting, and textures — does everything belong together?
