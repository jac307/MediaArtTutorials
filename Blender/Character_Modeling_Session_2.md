### 3️⃣ Open Your Environment File

- Open `YourName_SceneModel.blend`  
- Save as a new version if needed: `YourName_Scene_Final.blend`

---

### 4️⃣ Import Your Character

- File → Import → **Wavefront (.obj)**  
- Find your `.obj` file and import it  
- Select your character and **scale it proportionally**:
  - Use `S` to scale  
  - Use `G` to move it to the right position  
  - Use `R` to rotate if needed
- Add **materials** or **basic textures**: skin, metal, clothes, etc.  
- Optional: Use the **Hair Particle System** for simple hair/fur.  

🪄 **Tip:** Your character should match the size of the space (e.g., not taller than the wall or smaller than a bench!).

---

### 5️⃣ Add/Adjust Materials & Lighting

- Go to the **Shading** workspace  
- Add or tweak materials for:
  - Skin, eyes, hair, clothes, etc.  
- In your **Scene File**, add or reposition lights for dramatic effect:
  - Use **Area**, **Point**, or **Sun** lights  
  - Position for shadows, highlights, or mood
  - Adjust strength and color

---

## 💾 Save Frequently!

- File → Save  
- Final name: `YourName_CharacterInScene.blend`  
- Save to your USB or class folder

---

## 🪞 Creative Question

**Does your character feel “at home” in the space you created?**  
→ Think about proportions, lighting, and textures — does everything belong together?
