# 💡 Lighting & Materials in Blender  
**Time:** 1 hour

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Use lights and materials to bring your scene to life. Create atmosphere and emotion using color, surface texture, and light.

---

## 🧱 Start Here: Mood & Material Planning  
Before diving in, ask yourself:

- What mood do you want? (warm, eerie, soft, mysterious?)  
- What kind of materials would help? (glass, metal, cloth, plastic?)  
- Where is the light coming from in your world?

---

## 🎨 Step 1: Add Materials  
1. Select an object  
2. Go to the **Material Properties tab** (🟤 icon in bottom-right panel)  
3. Click **+ New**  
4. Change:
   - **Base Color**  
   - **Roughness** (smooth vs. matte)  
   - **Metallic** (non-metal to chrome)

📌 **Tips**  
- Lower roughness = more shine  
- Increase metallic = more futuristic look  
- You can add image textures, but start with basic settings

---

## 💡 Step 2: Add Lighting  
1. Go to `Shift + A → Light`  
2. Choose a light type:  
   - **Point** – Emits light from a single spot in all directions  
   - **Sun** – Mimics sunlight with parallel rays  
   - **Area** – Creates soft, even lighting  
   - **Spot** – Projects light in a cone (like a flashlight)

3. Move (`G`) and rotate (`R`) to place your light  
4. In the **Light Properties tab**, adjust:
   - **Strength**  
   - **Color**  
   - **Size / Angle** (for softness)

## 👁️ Step 3: Preview Your Scene  
- Switch to **Rendered View**: `Z → Rendered`  
- Or click the shaded ball icon in top-right of the 3D view
