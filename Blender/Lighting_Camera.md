# 💡 Lighting & 🎥 Camera  
**Time:** 40 min

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Learn how to set up lighting and a camera in Blender to create a mood or focus attention in your scene. Experiment with color, strength, and angle to change how your scene feels.

## Add Lighting  

### Step 1: Add a Light  
- `Shift + A → Light`  
- Choose from:  
  - **Point** – Emits light from one spot in all directions  
  - **Sun** – Mimics sunlight, great for outdoor scenes  
  - **Area** – Soft, rectangular light source (good for studio or room lighting)  
  - **Spot** – Cone-shaped light (useful for dramatic or focused light)

### Step 2: Position the Light  
- Use `G` to **move**, `R` to **rotate**

### Step 3: Adjust Light Settings  
- In the **Light Properties tab** (green lightbulb icon):  
  - Change **Strength** to make it brighter or dimmer  
  - Pick a **Color** to set mood  
  - Adjust **Size** (Area Light) or **Angle** (Sun Light) for softness

### Step 4: Preview the Lighting  
- `Z → Rendered` OR click the shaded ball in the top-right viewport corner  
- Switch to **Rendered View** to see how the light affects your scene

| 🛰️ Top Down (Bird’s Eye) | Use for maps, layouts, or god-like perspective                            |
| 🪟 Framed View           | Position camera through a window or doorway for visual framing            |

| 🎬 Close-Up              | Zoom in on a face, detail, or emotion; tight framing with shallow depth   |
| 🌍 Wide Shot             | Show the whole environment; helps with mood and scale                     |
